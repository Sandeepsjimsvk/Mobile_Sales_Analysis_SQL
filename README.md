Key Features:

Data Import and Transformation: Efficiently imported large datasets into SQL databases, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

Joins and Relationships: Utilized SQL joins to combine multiple tables containing sales transactions, product details, and geographic information.

Aggregate Functions: Employed aggregate functions to calculate total sales, average prices, and other key metrics.

Model Analysis: Identified the highest and lowest selling mobile models by analyzing sales data across different time periods.

Geographic Analysis: Determined the states, cities, and countries with the highest and lowest purchasing volumes.

Data Visualization: Created meaningful visualizations to represent sales trends and geographic distribution of mobile sales.

Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to provide actionable insights to stakeholders by analyzing mobile sales data, thereby facilitating data-driven decision-making for marketing strategies, inventory management, and sales optimization.
